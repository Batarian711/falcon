# The Falcon Innovation Project

An innovation project for Philippine Normal University's Faculty of Arts and Languages that schedules faculty, stores faculty profiles, and visualizes tracer study results.

Falcon's server is designed to run on the Node.js runtime environment. It uses express as the web framework to handle HTTP requests and responses. MongoDB facilitates the database layer, with Mongoose as the Object Document Mapper. Instead of using the traditional REST API approach for communicating with the client, Falcon uses GraphQL.

The client part of Falcon uses React to translate the app's internal state to a view, Redux to manage the state, and Material UI as the design language and component library.

### Run Instructions

The compiled files in the dist are generated by WebStorm's File Watcher through the Babel compiler in the dependencies. If you are not on WebStorm, you will have to manually compile the server and client scripts through Babel.
